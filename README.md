The provided code implements a virtual file system in Python and can be run as a standalone script. Here's a README explaining how to execute it:

**InMemoryFileSystem: A Python Virtual File System**

This Python script simulates a basic in-memory file system that allows you to create, navigate, view, and manipulate files and directories.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x

**Running the Script:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `main.py`).
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the `python` command:

```bash
python in_memory_fs.py
```

**User Interface:**

Once you execute the script, you'll be presented with a command prompt resembling this:

```
root/ >
```

This indicates the current directory is the root directory of your virtual file system. You can interact with the file system using commands similar to those used in Linux or terminal environments.

**Available Commands:**

- `mkdir <directory_name>`: Creates a new directory.
- `cd <directory_name>`: Changes the current directory.
- `ls <directory_path>`: Lists the contents of a directory.
- `touch <file_path>`: Creates a new empty file.
- `echo <content> <file_path>`: Writes content to a file.
- `cat <file_path>`: Displays the contents of a file.
- `grep <pattern> <file_path>`: Searches for a pattern within a file.
- `mv <source> <destination>`: Moves a file or directory to another location.
- `cp <source> <destination>`: Copies a file or directory to another location.
- `rm <file_path>`: Removes a file or directory. (**Caution: This operation is permanent**)
- `exit`: Exits the program.

**Example Usage:**

```
root/ > mkdir documents  # Create a directory named "documents"
root/ > cd documents
documents/ > touch report.txt  # Create a file named "report.txt"
documents/ > echo "This is a sample report." report.txt  # Write content to the file
documents/ > cat report.txt  # Display the content of "report.txt"
documents/ > cd ..  # Move back to the root directory
root/ > ls  # List the contents of the root directory (which should now include "documents")
root/ > exit  # Exit the program
```

**Note:**

- The file system operates entirely in memory and persists only during the current program execution. Once you exit the script, all created files and directories are lost.
- This is a basic implementation and lacks features of a full-fledged file system.
